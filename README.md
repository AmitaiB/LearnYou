# LearnYou

LearnYou is (going to be) a simple peer-to-peer information support tool. It has two primary mechanisms to grease the wheels of knowledge in a class:
*Make learners aware of their peers' relative competencies, so they know who to ask for help (and do not feel bashful about doing so).
*Act as a clearinghouse for learners to 'open tickets' for faculty help, allowing the faculty to be the Efficient Dispatcher (who's on deck for Q&A?).

## Coming Soon:
1. BackEnd DB (Either Google Sheets or Parse).
2. iOS app.
